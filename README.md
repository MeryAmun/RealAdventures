This project was built using npm create - react-app.After this installation,I proceeded to setup the various components.
I installed react-router-dom to setup links and brouser router paths.Then I installed reduc,and react-redux to connect the react app to the redux store.
Futhrermore I used Higher Order Components like connect to bind the state of the redux store to the props of ther component.
